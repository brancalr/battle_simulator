================

This is a simple battle program written as part of a class assignment. Each player chooses a team of 3 fighters from the available options and then combat begins. The winning fighter goes to the back of their team queue and the losing fighter goes to the losers stack. Battle continues until only one fighter remains alive and the top 3 fighters are displayed along with the player that selected them.
